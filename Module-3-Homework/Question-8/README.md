**Answer:** False

### Explanation:
While clustering improves performance and reduces costs for many queries, it's not a universal best practice for all scenarios. For tables smaller than 1 GB, the metadata overhead may outweigh the benefits, and the performance gain is negligible. The decision to use grouping should be based on table size and query patterns.
